How to play:

- Open the above link on a laptop or desktop computer, as the game requires a keyboard.
- Count the number of pumpkins on screen, and type that number on the keyboard.
- If you type the correct number, you win!
- If you need a bit of help, press space to show hints on top of the pumpkins.
