# Pumpkin Games

Some simple games to I made to help my kids practice letters and numbers.

Play here: ðŸ‘‰ [**jichu4n.github.io/pumpkin-games**](https://jichu4n.github.io/pumpkin-games/) ðŸ‘ˆ

Note that the games require a physical keyboard, so you'll need to use a laptop / desktop.

Practice the alphabet!

How to play:

- When you've captured 12 pumpkins, you win! You can press space to restart the game.
- Click the icon in the top right to change game settings like speed and uppercase / lowercase letters.
